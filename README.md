# Hive Reusable Dropdown Menu Component Challenge

Initialized project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) (React + TypeScript + Vite)

I added some comments around the code to provide some insight.\
The next thing that I would have added in is search functionality which would be useful if there are many options.
